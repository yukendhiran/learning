## The Art of Learning

Alright, I'm about to drop some unconventional advice. I think totally differently. Instead of focusing on learning how to learn effectively, let's talk about increasing your brain's computing power.

Wait, what? Yeah, if you do anything out of the ordinary, the number of neurons in your brain will increase, leading to more computing power.

Patterns are just illusions that you create, convincing yourself that you are a certain way and should behave accordingly.

The unconventional activities I engage in really strengthen my neuromuscular strength and keep my brain healthy. Here's a snapshot of my wild journey: I go from normal to extreme exercise for several months, then suddenly stop for no reason and fall into laziness. Next, I start doing yoga for several months, get addicted to video games and series, then switch to cardio. After a while, I return to normalcy, then start doing calisthenics, drawing, crafting, and some other random activities.

So, the key is randomness. Through this, you can truly build strength, flexibility, and stamina Additionally, your physical strength is directly correlated with your mental strength.

This is how I gained the power to do anything at my will. It always keeps my brain curious and leads to a lot of trial and error.
